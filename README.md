Easy day-to-day usage projects via Arduino.

## What is an Arduino ?
Arduino is a open-source electronic platform comprising of both software and hardware . The hardware part is  a [microcontroller](https://www.engineersgarage.com/microcontroller) which is controlled by the Arduino programming language through **it's own IDE(Integrated Development Environment)**. It was initially created by the Ivrea Interaction Design Institute as a tool for fast prototyping. It is widely used by electronics enthusiasts around the world who have used create projects of various complexity and thus have contributed to the open-source community .

## Why Arduino ?
Arduino programming language is roughly based on C++ which makes it free of any hardcore-programming. Thus anyone- children,hobbyists, artists,scientists can start working on the same. The fact that it is open-source and runs across platforms- Windows, MacOS, Linux operating systems gives it an edge over other microcontrollers which mainly run on Windows-based systems .

## Getting Started
### Install Arduino IDE
Please install Arduino IDE software.
* For [Windows](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows)
* For [MacOS](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/MacOSX)
* For [Linux distributions](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Linux)

### Selecting the Right Board
Arduino Hardware provides the user with an extensive list of boards, each used in different fields .
This [table](Products) gives us a list of boards and their categories .
All of my projects were done in Arduino Uno R3 .If you live in India, [this](https://robu.in/) is a good store where you shall find a variety of Arduino products- boards, casings, jumper wires etc.
